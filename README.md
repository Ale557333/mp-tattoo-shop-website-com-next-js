# Tattoo Shop - Website with Next.js

Start your practice with Next.js by creating a commercial website for a hypothetical tattoo artist named Sandro Luz. Build the entire Next.js project from scratch.

## 🤓 Before you start

In this mini project, there is no initial template/boilerplate. You will need to start the project from scratch.

## 🔨 Requirements

- Initialize the project from scratch using `create-next-app`
- Create 4 pages for "Sandro Luz Tattoo Shop":
  - Home
  - Services
  - About
  - Contact
- Use all native Next.js features, such as: `next/link`, `next/image`, `next/font`;
- The contact button (both in the navbar and on the contact page) should be a link to WhatsApp's click-to-chat functionality (https://faq.whatsapp.com/5913398998672934). This link should open in a new tab;
- Use the App Router (instead of the Pages Router);
- Use images directly from Figma (exporting them);
- As a suggestion, use TailwindCSS for styling.

## 🔨 Extra Challenge for those who want to go further

- Add some animations. This could be for the image and text on the home page or the navbar when switching links, for example.

## 🎨 Suggested Design

We have a suggested design in Figma. However, feel free to create the application based on your own creativity.
